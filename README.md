## First, click 'Open in New Window', otherwise routing won't work correctly

## To play around, check out these files (look for 'play with it' comments):

- `libs/feature-example/src/lib/example.component.ts`
- `libs/state-example/src/lib/example.repository.ts`

## Possible scenario:

1. Check the default store value
2. Note how it's being overwritten by query params on init
3. Write your params using the button
4. Reload page using the button
5. Check how your params were parsed and set to store
6. Clear params using the button
7. Reload page using the button (welcome back to the step 2)
